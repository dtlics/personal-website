Working on this repo: https://github.com/dalmia/David-Silver-Reinforcement-learning.git, I've created a pull request to fix 2 bugs so that the answer provided by the author can work properly. This PR really feels good, lol.",

I tried to look for exercises/tutorials to learn better, and it turns out that I'm right to do so. (Since there a whole repo for this) Cool, let me get to it right away, lol.",
