      "I've been studying David Silver's RL course for a week now. But those concepts are really confusing so I started to find some tutorial material to have some exercise. Working on this repo: https://github.com/dalmia/David-Silver-Reinforcement-learning.git, I've created a pull request to fix 2 bugs so that the answer provided by the author can work properly. This PR really feels good, lol.",

I tried to look for exercises/tutorials to learn better, and it turns out that I'm right to do so. (Since there a whole repo for this) Cool, let me get to it right away, lol.",

        <p>Year 3 course selection began today, but I just found loads of time clashes among the courses I dream to take. Though heart-broken, there's still hope, lol. So let me write the courses that I'm going to learn by myself down for my future reference.</p>

          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>MATH3301 Algebra 1: </a>Relatively easy, but is very fundamental. What some structures (group, ring, field) are and their easy propertities.</p>

          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>MATH4302 Algebra 2: </a>More interesting. Part A: What is PID and UFD; Part B: Field Theory, domain extension and Galois Theory; Part C: Module Theory (Based on PID) -- "Best course in HKU"(Ning, 2019)</p>

          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>MATH3401 Analysis 1: </a>More familiar. Metric Topology. The basis for analytics. A generalization of MATH2241 but 2241 is not a necessity. Useful in understanding CS problems systemetically, especially when dealing with computational geometry stuff.</p>
        <p><a href="https://webapp.science.hku.hk/sr4/servlet/enquiry?Type=Course&course_code=MATH3541"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>MATH3541 Topology: </a>Point Set Topology (which can be regarded as a generalization of Metric Topology) with some Algebraic Topology (Including Fundamental Group and Covering Space). Important course and very fundamental. It needs a bit of abstract algebra so it's best to ocnsider it after taking Algebra 1 and Analysis 1. TCS also needs topology, especially if my research interest is computational geometry.</p>

          style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>MATH3901 Operations Research 1: </a>Very useful. LP and SDP are very important and are everywhere. "But avoid Xiaoming Yuan since he's course might be a bit awful"(Ning, 2019)</p>
