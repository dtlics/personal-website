Working on this repo: https://github.com/dalmia/David-Silver-Reinforcement-learning.git, I've created a pull request to fix 2 bugs so that the answer provided by the author can work properly.

Anyway, I'm pretty happy that I did know how to study RL afterall. I tried to look for exercises/tutorials to learn better, and it turns out that I'm right to do so.
